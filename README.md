# low-level-design-lab  

A personal collection of **low-level design explorations, UML diagrams, and code skeletons** as I practice building clean, extensible, and maintainable systems.  

Each folder focuses on a specific problem (e.g., Parking Lot, BookMyShow, Chess, Ride-Sharing), documenting the **requirements, object modeling, class interactions, design choices, and key learnings**.  

📌 **Goal:** Build a structured knowledge base of **OOP principles, design patterns, and code-level reasoning** that I can reuse for interviews and real-world development.  

⚡ **Note:** These designs are for **learning and discussion** purposes. I’ve refined them through practice, reading, and AI-assisted reasoning.

## 📂 Problem Write-up Template 

Each problem write-up follows the same template for consistency:  

1. **Problem statement** – What we’re designing and the scope.  
2. **Requirements** – Functional and non-functional needs.  
3. **Key entities & responsibilities** – Core classes/objects and their roles.  
4. **Class diagram (UML)** – Relationships between entities.  
5. **Core workflows** – Step-by-step object interactions.  
6. **Code skeleton (Java/Python/etc.)** – Core classes and methods.  
7. **Design principles & patterns** – SOLID, GRASP, and relevant design patterns used.  
8. **Trade-offs & alternatives** – Other possible designs and pros/cons.  
9. **Extensions / next steps** – Features or improvements beyond v1.

## 🔍 Optional Add-ons for Advanced Practice  

These are not typically required in interviews, but useful for deepening understanding and building a richer reference library:  

10. **Use-case Diagram** – Map actors (e.g., Member, Librarian) to top-level actions like search, checkout, reserve.  
11. **Activity or Sequence Diagram** – Show the detailed steps of a core workflow (e.g., how a book checkout flows across objects).  
12. **CRC Cards (Brainstorming Tool)** – For each class:  
   - **Name**: Class name  
   - **Responsibilities**: What it does  
   - **Collaborators**: Other classes it interacts with
